## Variables.

#### How to assign a **variable**:
```
x = 5.to_i
str = 'hello'
```
Creates a variable x and sets equal to integer 5, creates a variable str and sets equal to string 'hello'.
The `.to_i` makes the 5 an integer value.

#### How to use a **variable**
`return str`

This will return 'hello,' as we previously set it to 'hello.'

You can also do math with integer strings:
`x + 5`
This will equal 10.

#### How to create **types**
